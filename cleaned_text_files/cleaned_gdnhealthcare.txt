What working in a mental health hospital taught me about attending to the needs of patients: 
After the Health and Social Care Act was labelled ‘a huge waste of money’, the priority must now be integration:  #NHS
Check out the top ten campaigns from #NHSChangeDay 
'The biggest issue is funding: everyone, from trade unions to thinktanks, is agreed that the #NHS needs more money.' 
Getting lost in hospitals is costing the #NHS and patients 
#PairedLearning #StopthePressure #MyMeds and more featured in today's list of #NHSChangeDay campaigns 
Raising sepsis awareness and helping women through the menopause: two of the grassroots projects from #NHSChangeDay 
Mental health HCA: 'We must never forget that we work mostly with patients who have been systematically neglected.' 
If you missed #gdnhealthhustings last night, find out how the parties responded to your questions here:  #NHS
'Before I became a healthcare assistant on an acute ward I had assumed that mental health hospitals were dangerous.' 
'I can see the system's failed the patient and I almost want to apologise on behalf of a health service I represent.' 
Post election needs: 'To make progress on prevention, it’s not just a job for the NHS, it’s a job across government.' 
'We must, and can, do much more to value HCAs and to invest in them.'  #NHS
'The best thing about being a doctor in the NHS today is having insider knowledge.'  #ViewsfromtheNHSfrontline
'What being a HCA has taught me is that the foundation for good mental health is relationships.'  #NHS
Last night, the 3 biggest political parties set out their plans &amp; answered your questions:  #gdnhealthhustings
As healthcare assistants we are often the least trained but most hands-on #NHS staff 
We've summed up the 10 best campaigns from #NHSChangeDay – read them here:
