# health_news_LDA_topics
Investigating LDA on short, specific health news text data and subsets of women's, men's and children's health to see differences in salience and frequency of terms across subsets.

The goal of this project was to 1) use LDA on shorter data like tweets within a specific domain, and 2) identify differences in predominant topics and their salience with smaller subsets of women's health news, men's health news, and health news related to children. The health news tweets were obtained from the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/438/health+news+in+twitter), and contain tweets from several different news sources. This analysis uses the cleaned Reuters dataset due to its size and global news coverage.

The full code with helper functions commented and with markdown descriptions can be found in the [analysis_code.ipynb](https://github.com/oishani-b/health_news_LDA_topics/blob/545fa3777aa13fb1cd5c994f75449c35f2796615/analysis_code.ipynb) file. Download the file and dataset to run and view the pyLDAVis visualizations (the interactive visualizations might not appear in github without running the jupyter notebook). More discussion and overview of the methods can be found in the [presentation.pdf](https://github.com/oishani-b/health_news_LDA_topics/blob/545fa3777aa13fb1cd5c994f75449c35f2796615/presentation.pdf) file. Some of the most relevant conclusions, observations, and selections from the interactive visualizations are presented here.

**Takeaways and Observations**:
- **LDA for short, specific texts**: LDA does seem to work for shorter texts! While playing around with the coherence scores and number of topics was needed to get interpretable topics, there were surprisingly insightful topics, and looking at their high frequency terms was useful to get a general idea of the contents of the dataset without looking at it closely.
- **Coherence for shorter documents**: Coherence did not work conventionally as a metric for this data. It was primarily useful to get the coherence plots for any number of topics from 2 to 15, and finding the topics with the highest coherence was useful, but did not end up being the best number for interpretability in most cases. The point after which there were 'diminishing' returns for a higher number of topics, or the 'elbow' point, was a more useful metric for this. Using the LDA visualizations to get a good number of topics based on actual interpretatability of the high frequency terms in each of the topics was a great technique that used the coherence plots but did not rely on the max coherence. This might have been due to the texts being short (health tweets), the topics already being defined, resulting in generally higher coherence before modeling with LDA, or a tendency to overfit the data with a higher number of topics when the dataset is large (across all the news, not the subsets).
- **Subsetting specific subtopics using keywords**: Looking at the salient and frequent terms within the women's, men's and children's health subsets was interesting. The women's health data was generally more political, with legal and geographical terms appearing more important across specific topics, most likely due to the prevalence of abortion discussions. Meanwhile, the men's data was both smaller and had the highest coherence for only 2 topics, which were quite easy to interpret, and did not include political or children-related terms. The children's health data topics were more spread out and harder to interpret, but 5 topics did model them fairly well given the small size of the sample. The gendered split across frequent and salient terms with this data was interesting, with 'women' and 'mother' appearing important in certain topics, but not 'men' and 'father'.

As seen in the visualization with 3 topics, Topic 1 seems to be generally about public health and disease, with words like 'risk', 'case', and 'outbreak' having highest frequency within this topic. Topic 2 seems more oriented towards testing and studying of medication, with high frequency terms including 'drug', 'study', and 'fda'. Meanwhile, Topic 3 seems to be about diseases in Africa, with the highest frequency term being 'ebola', and other high frequency terms including 'africa', 'liberia', 'sierra', and 'leone'. These topics are fairly easy to interpret as distinct from each other, showing that LDA can still be effective on smaller documents such as tweets, within a specific domain. Choosing the number of topics to be 3 based on the intertopic distance visualizations was helpful to find an interpretable number of topics in this case.

- **Women's Health News Subset**
<img width="2756" height="1524" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0469f9c-e34d-4c15-b597-e36e8dd4e69c" />

Looking at the visualizations themselves, the topics are generally interpretable. Topic 1 has abortion as the most relevant term for that topic, with words like 'law', 'court' and 'strike' being frequent terms. Topic 2 seems to be tied to disease and studies that were about women specifically, with 'woman' being the highest frequency term and other frequent words including 'study', 'obese', and 'depression'. Topic 3 has 'birth' and 'baby' as some of the most frequent terms, and words like 'pediatrician' and 'cancer' appear, making this topic most likely about infant and baby health and disease. Topic 4 is about cancers and their treatments, with the highest frequency term being 'cancer', and terms like 'drug' and 'pill' are frequent, as well as 'roche' and 'avastin'. Roche is a pharmaceutical company that provides cancer treatments, and Avastin is a cancer drug designed to work with chemotherapy. Topic 5 was harder to interpret, with 'top' being the most relevant and highest frequency term in the topic, while the other topics were more spread out, although words like 'restriction' and 'pregnancy' had higher term frequencies in this topic than others.

- **Men's Health News Subset**
<img width="2768" height="1494" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe3e8be-66dc-48d2-b3f9-dd9122e874b1" />

Looking at the topics, there are clear distinctions between each of them. Topic 1 seems to be about men's sexual health specifically, with some of the highest frequency words being 'gay', 'bisexual', 'hiv' and 'treatment'. Meanwhile, Topic 2 seems to be a mix of more general health terms, as well as terms more applicable to men's health but not as many terms specifically abotu sexual health. Some of the high frequency words in Topic 2 include 'cancer', 'virus', and 'erectile'. These 2 topics are fairly interpretable, but may not be the best use of LDA due to the small subset of data used to model these topics.

It is interesting to note that men's health news topics generally contain less political terms than the women's health topics, with no mentions of 'law' or 'court' (some of the more salient terms in the women's subset), and less geographic references (also more prevalent in the women's subset, probably due to abortion-related legality being varied across states ang geographic regions reporting on women's health with specific state laws).

- **Children's Health News Subset**
<img width="2976" height="1510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce52d68e-4630-4904-9af9-4ec2a1add6d4" />

With n = 5, the topics are not very distinct from each other, but do seem to have distinctions when looking at where the salient terms are most frequent. Topic 1 seems tied to mental health or more socially discussed health issues, with highest frequency words in the topic including 'cigarette', 'obesity', 'anxious', and 'social'. Topic 1 also included 'son' as a highly frequent term, but not 'daughter', which is interesting given the other frequent words in the topic being about socially discussed health issues. Topic 2 seems to be about teen health issues, with higher frequency terms including 'drug', 'death', 'teen', 'program', and 'school'. Topic 3 is relatively difficult to interpret, with 'suicide', 'woman', and 'infant' appearing as high frequency terms. It seems to tie together generally more deadly or high-risk health news tweets. Again, 'woman' appears as a highly frequent term, but not 'man', which might be due to complications during birth mentioning women more than men. Topic 4 is about widespread disease and children, with 'ebola' being one of the highest frequency terms in it, other words including 'pediatrician' and 'vaccine'. Topic 5 seems to be about infant health, with 'mother', 'parent', and 'infant' being highly frequent terms.

Another interesting observation: while 'mother' appears as a salient term across the topics, and as a high frequency term in Topic 1 and Topic 5, 'father' does not appear in either of them, or make it to the 30 most salient terms in this data. Even with changed number of topics to 8, the term 'father' does not appear as high frequency within the topics, or high salience across documents. While this can be explained by some of the data being specific to childbirth, it is interesting to observe the lack of the term 'father' even in topics of teen health or children's mental health.
